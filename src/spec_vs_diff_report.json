  "summary": "Most frontend structure appears to implement the 5-page site with shared header/footer, responsive navigation, SEO helper, and a wired contact form with client-side validation. The backend persists contact entries but does not meet the required data fields (missing mobile and timestamp) and introduces extra, unrequested authentication scaffolding and an admin-like retrieval API.",
